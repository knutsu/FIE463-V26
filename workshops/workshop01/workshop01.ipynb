        "# Exercise 1: Type conversions\n",
        "\n",
        "In the lecture, we discussed the basic built-in data types: integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings. Python allows us to convert one type to another using the following functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [`int()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) converts its argument to an integer.\n",
        "- [`float()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) converts its argument to a floating-point number. \n",
        "- [`bool()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool) converts its argument to a boolean.\n",
        "- [`str()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) converts its argument to a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "These conversions mostly work in an intuitive fashion, with some exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Define a string variable `s` with the value `'1.1'`. Convert this variable to an integer, a float, and a boolean.\n",
        "2.  Define the string variables `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` with values `'True'`, `'False'`, and `''` (empty string), respectively. Convert each of these to a boolean. Can you guess the conversion rule?\n",
        "3.  Define a floating-point variable `x` with the value `0.9`. Convert this variable to an integer, a boolean, and a string.\n",
        "4.  Define the integer variables `i1` and `i2` with values `0` and `2`, respectively. Convert each of these variables to a boolean.\n",
        "5.   Define the boolean variables `b1` and `b2` with values `True` and `False`, respectively. Convert each of them to an integer.\n",
        "6.  NumPy arrays cannot be converted using `int()`, `float()`, etc. Instead, we have to use the \n",
        "    method [`astype()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html) \n",
        "    and pass the desired data type (e.g., `int`, `float`, `bool`) as an argument.\n",
        "    Create a NumPy array called `arr` with elements `[0.0, 0.5, 1.0]` and convert it to an integer\n",
        "    and a boolean type.\n"
